ios-learning
========

This is going to be a repo of a bunch of the stuff I have used, read, and built while messing around with iOS. The primary motivation for learning iOS development in the first place is to do a couple cool projects at Uber, but it'll still require me to get my hands dirty on nights and weekends.

It's worth noting that as I'm staring this repo in October 2018, I actually have already built a couple non-trivial iOS Apps, but it was back in the 2014-2015 timerange working at [Mutual Mobile](https://mutualmobile.com/work), [RealMassive](https://www.realmassive.com/), and building [GamePlan](https://github.com/UTGamePlan/GamePlanIOS) on the side.

Hopefully someone else finds all this useful! If you find other resources that are valuable, please submit a PR!

## Books
I learn best through books, so if you are looking for a good book for getting started in iOS, I suggest:
- [iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/ios-programming/): This book provides a solid conceptual overview in a project-based structure so you'll spend more time coding than with other books. It covers all the most important View Controller types, introduces you to MVC architecture, and gives you a chance to interact with many of the important frameworks.
- [Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/swift-programming/): To work with iOS, you'll probably want to use [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). This book is fine for someone with little to no programming experience; learning the basics of Swift is fairly easy. If you are used to using modern languages, like Java 8+ or Python, you'll probably catch on to most of the nuances of Swift fairly easily (Optioals, Generics, etc.) but it really can't hurt to have a reference text, and this is one that gets you working in the playgrounds so you feel comfortable early on.

## Apps

- [UT GamePlan](https://github.com/UTGamePlan/GamePlanIOS): Built by myself and [@courtbohrer](https://github.com/courtbohrer) back in 2014, this was an app that showed you tailgates and parties on game days during football season. We used Facebook's now-defunct [Parse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_(platform)) on the backend and the [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) for users to invite their friends. Our biggest weekend, we had 4k users. The app was eventually removed from the store because of a cease-and-desist from UT.

- [RealMassive iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id894642997) As an intern, built the iOS client app for real-estate agents and brokers to use while talking with clients.
